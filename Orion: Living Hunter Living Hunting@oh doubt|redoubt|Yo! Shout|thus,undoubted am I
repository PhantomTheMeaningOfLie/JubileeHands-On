Genkai+Blossom@straight : "greetin's compeers we wish to stay at Pasio Islands for a week to celebrate meeting each other again after undercover operations.."
Cosmic@scowl : "you travelled by floating on a log for 3 days from Pebblefog to Pasio even if you never had any natural needs all you did meanwhile was to stare at each other without an wink after which Slalom Seldom said in the beginning and now at the end you recognised me as i to which Column Jargon replied though i concur i noticed a redundancy of holding you as a practice for me in consolidation to redundancy..and even after you believe you're treated as dual..legally#..The Redundancy of  Duality,#,..Genkai+Blossom un..long,#,.."

Orion@straight : "so you mean my time at the prison of bottomless hell is over?..but i was told there's no way i could've been forgiven given i equated self with survival then both are unparametrically eternally in chain of duality#..Livin' Painter,#,.."
Cosmic Enforcement@scowl : "you've been purged by..reality..move it#..Livin' Painter,#,.."
Orion@shrug : "fair enough well well still the eternity since i last was out to live has passed by let's see if any me wishes to know..who am i..
oh light/dark night/stumbled on randomness/of i/seen by/i and my-ness..
existence..caution..upon Pebbles of Consciousness.."
Cosmic@you should be at Marengo shouldn't you rather at Cerulean shows your ego or is it just our concen over it#..Refill Concern,#,.."
Orion : "I don't understand it respected ones why can't liberation be a counter to it's need#..Livin' Hunter,#,.."
Pertinence@laughing : "it's been a while ain't it compeer since you last were found as i#..Livin' Painter,#,.."
Orion : "indeed respected ones but this calm water of the Cerulean lake reminds me of the much celebrated simile of..shh..

hence doer/or seer/or just whom am i..
